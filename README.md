# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

### Purpose

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies, so it has requested to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data will need to be processed to fit the unsupervised machine learning models.  To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm will be used. Plotly and hvplot visualizations will be used to share the findings.

### Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
